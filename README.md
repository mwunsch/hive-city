# Hive City

Hive City is a study in video game design and development. The goal of
this project is to build a game inspired by Specialist Games'
[_Necromunda_][necromunda] using the [Elm][elm-lang] platform.

This is a repository to house my attempts to better understand the
problems involved in:

+ The Elm language, tools, and ecosystem
+ The Elm Architecture and the ongoing evolution of Functional
  Reactive Programming
+ Making a game
+ Modeling entities and state in a computer game inspired by a
  physical counterpart
+ And getting to immerse myself in a funky, esoteric game from the
  90's
